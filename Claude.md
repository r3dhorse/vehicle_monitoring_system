# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Vehicle Monitoring System built as a Google Apps Script Web Application that tracks vehicle movements through organizational gates/checkpoints.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Google Apps Script (server-side JavaScript)
- **Database**: Google Sheets (Spreadsheet ID: `1OMlsS2W_N566ZEC4K9bXutQdu0qCB67Q7ezZCN1w7u8`)
- **Frontend**: Single-page application in `app.html` using Bootstrap 5.3.0
- **Authentication**: Custom implementation with SHA-256 password hashing and salt
- **QR Code Support**: jsQR 1.4.0 for vehicle identification
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.0 with Bootstrap Icons 1.11.3

## Architecture

The system follows a Google Apps Script Web App architecture:

1. **Code.gs** (4,715 lines): Server-side logic with 94 functions handling:

   - Authentication and authorization (RBAC with roles: super-admin, admin, security)
   - CRUD operations for vehicles, drivers, and gates
   - In/Out logging with audit trails
   - Caching system for performance optimization
   - All database operations through Google Sheets API

2. **app.html** (8,567 lines): Complete frontend as a single file containing:
   - HTML structure
   - Embedded CSS with mobile-responsive design
   - Client-side JavaScript for UI interactions
   - Communication with backend via `google.script.run` API

## Key Data Structures

Google Sheets used as database tables:

- **VehicleMaster**: Vehicle registration details (Column A = Vehicle ID, Column B = Plate Number)
- **DriverMaster**: Driver information
- **InOutLogs**: Movement tracking records
- **Users**: System users with roles and permissions
- **Gates**: Gate/checkpoint definitions

### VehicleMaster Sheet Structure

| Column | Field              | Description                              |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| A      | Vehicle ID         | 6-digit padded ID (000001, 000002, etc.) |
| B      | Plate Number       | Vehicle license plate                    |
| C      | Make/Model         | Vehicle description                      |
| D      | Color              | Vehicle color                            |
| E      | Department/Company | Owner department                         |
| F      | Year               | Manufacturing year                       |
| G      | Type               | Vehicle type (Car, Truck, Van, etc.)     |
| H      | Status             | Current status (IN/OUT)                  |
| I      | Current Driver     | Currently assigned driver                |
| J      | Assigned Drivers   | List of authorized drivers               |
| K      | Access Status      | Access level (Access/No Access/Banned)   |
| L      | One Time Pass      | Temporary access flag (Yes/No)           |
| M      | MV File            | Motor Vehicle file number or reference   |

## Development Commands

This is a Google Apps Script project - no build tools, npm commands, or testing framework. Development workflow:

1. Edit files in Google Apps Script Editor or push via clasp
2. Deploy as Web App through Google Apps Script  
3. The `doGet()` function serves the application
4. Use `clearAllCaches()` function for manual cache management during development

## Important Implementation Notes

- Password hashing uses SHA-256 with UUID salt in format: `salt:hash`
- Caching implemented via `CacheService.getScriptCache()` for performance
- All client-server communication uses Google's `google.script.run` async API
- Input sanitization implemented in `sanitizeInput()` function
- Session management through custom token system
- Role-based permissions enforced at function level

### QR Code System

- **Vehicle Identification**: System uses Vehicle IDs (column A) for QR code lookups
- **ID Format**: Vehicle IDs are 6-digit padded (e.g., "000001", "000002")
- **QR Processing**: Automatically detects numeric QR codes as Vehicle IDs vs plate numbers
- **Lookup Functions**:
  - `getVehicleById()` - handles padded/unpadded vehicle ID lookups
  - `getVehicleByPlate()` - traditional plate number lookups
- **Frontend Integration**: Smart detection in `processQRCodeData()` determines lookup method
- **Compatibility**: Supports both "1" and "000001" formats for same vehicle

### Vehicle Management

- **Modal Forms**: Responsive Bootstrap modals for add/edit vehicle operations
- **Form Fields**: All 13 vehicle fields including new MV File column
- **Data Validation**: Required field validation and duplicate plate number checks
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization between frontend and Google Sheets
- **Column Updates**: System automatically handles 13-column data structure
- **Sample Data**: Includes realistic MV File examples (e.g., "MV-2022-001")
- **Driver Assignment**:
  - Multi-select dropdown for assigning multiple drivers to vehicles
  - Dynamic loading of active drivers from DriverMaster sheet
  - Current driver dropdown populated from assigned drivers
  - Maintains many-to-many relationship between vehicles and drivers

## Security Considerations

- Never expose the Google Sheets ID in client-side code
- All sensitive operations require authentication tokens
- Input validation required for all user inputs
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- Permission checks before any CRUD operations

## Recent Updates

### Database Schema Changes

- **Added MV File Column**: New column M in VehicleMaster sheet for Motor Vehicle file references

5. **Backend Processing**: Update `saveVehicleRecord()` to handle new field
6. **Sample Data**: Add realistic examples to `createSampleData()` function
7. **Documentation**: Update VehicleMaster table structure in this file

### Driver Management Implementation
The system implements a simplified driver management structure:

#### DriverMaster Sheet Structure (Simplified)

| Column | Field         | Description                          |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| A      | Driver ID     | Unique identifier                    |
| B      | Name          | Driver full name                     |
| C      | Department    | Department/Company                   |
| D      | Phone         | Contact phone number                 |
| E      | Status        | Active/Inactive status               |

#### Driver Management Modal

  - Test current driver dropdown displays only driver names (no license numbers)
  - Confirm InOutLogs record driver names instead of IDs
  - Verify transaction remarks show proper driver name changes
  - Test `migrateDriverIdsToNames()` function on test data
